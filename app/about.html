        <h2>About CoffeeTurn.com</h2>
        <h3>How we started</h3>
        One day walking with some colleagues to get coffee we started discussing who's turn it was to pay.<br>
        We all had a feeling we had not paid for a while as well as a feeling some people pay less often.<br>
        So we came up with the idea of making a page that would allow people to keep track of all the coffees we all buy
        for each other.<br>
        No matter how the group changes the app will able to tell you who should pay for coffe next and keeps tabs on
        the exceptions.
        <h3>Who are we</h3>
        we are a consulting firm that, from time to time, has to build something like this site just for the fun and
        entertainment.
