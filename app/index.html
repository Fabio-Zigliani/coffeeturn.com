        <h2>About CoffeeTurn.com</h2>
        <h3>How we started</h3>
        One day walking with some colleagues to get coffee we started discussing who's turn it was to pay.<br>
        We all had a feeling we had not paid for a while as well as a feeling some people pay less often.<br>
        So we came up with the idea of making a page that woudl allow people to keep track of all the coffees we all buy
        for each other. No matter how the group changes the app will able to tell you who should pay for coffe.
        <h3>Who are we</h3>
        we are a consulting firm that, from time to time, has to build something like this site just for the fun and entertainment.
